First i followed the [Dockerfile](https://github.com/jeromerobert/centos7-gcc13/blob/main/Dockerfile) by [Jerome Robert](https://github.com/jeromerobert) at [jeromerobert/centos7-gcc13](https://github.com/jeromerobert/centos7-gcc13). I failed to install MPC 1.3 due to an MPFR 4.1 dependency, and CMAKE 3.27 due to compilation issue with OpenSSL. To download source files, i used GNU's India mirror from [GNU Mirror list](https://www.gnu.org/prep/ftp.en.html). Finally to install GCC 13.2, i ran `./contrib/download_prerequisites` before running `./configure`, thanks to an [answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/38460654/1413259) by [Joseph Hansen](https://stackoverflow.com/users/756329/joseph-hansen) at stackoverflow. It's a success!
